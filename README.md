React Sandbox Projects
These are the two React projects that I have created so far.
One is a simple to-do list and is, what I found to be, the traditional starter project when learning React.
The second project is a website, which I tried incorporating React Hooks and HOCs in order to further develop my React skills.
Both projects use Node.js in order to, in my understanding, use the create-react-app command in order to facilitate building the skeleton of the app functionality.
